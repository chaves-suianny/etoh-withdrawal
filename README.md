Data packages for the research project "Behavioral and biochemical effects of ethanol withdrawal in zebrafish". Data is produced by members from Laboratório de Neurociências e Comportamento "Frederico Guilherme Graeff", affiliated to Universidade Federal do Sul e Sudeste do Pará and Universidade do Estado do Pará.
The package includes primary data for a behavioral experiment on the effects of ethanol withdrawal on zebrafish anxiety-like behavior, pilocarpine-induced seizures, and catalase activity, as well as data and scripts for a meta-analysis of behavioral data on zebrafish. The preprint that was submitted to bioRxiv is also included here, for the sake of completion.
