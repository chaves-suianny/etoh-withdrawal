Biochemical data from the in vitro catalase activity experiment, on brains and head kidneys dissected from animals exposed to the withdrawal protocol.
Datasets represent average catalase activities, determined following the Aebi (1984) method, and calculated as a constant k = (1/ \delta t)(ln A1/A2), where \delta t refers to the time interval used in the experiments (i.e., 30 s between measurements M1 and M2), and A1 and A2 refer to absorbances for measurements M1 and M2.
Datasets include analytic validation assays, as well as experimental data on brains and head kidneys.

Includes the following files:
* datapackage.json Frictionless Data Specification for the data file
* teste.csv Data file
* etoh-withdrawal-catalase-notebook.Rmd R Markdown file with code for reproducible statistical analysis and figures
